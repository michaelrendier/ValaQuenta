HamiltonianXP — H = xp (Berry & Keating, 1999)

The lossless semantic engine.

Classical orbit:     xp = E  (hyperbola — enumerates the primes)
Equations of motion: ẋ =  x  (no loops)
                     ṗ = -p  (no branches)
Scale invariant:     x → λx, p → p/λ, H → H (same at every language, every context)

The prime emerges from the evolution. It is not searched for.
No If/Then/Else. No While. Continuous flow.

Three phases are automatic:
  Classical orbit (xp = E)     → the semantic prime          [RED  / Riemann]
  Quantum zeros  (γₙ)          → the formant structure        [BLUE / Fermat]
  Time evolution (e^{iHt}|ψ⟩) → the carrier waveform         [Yang-Mills]

    The functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1−s) is the symmetry between them.
    By Noether's theorem, this symmetry generates two conserved currents:

    and E_Blue(x,p) are two independently-defined functions of (x,p); nothing
    forces them to agree except at the specific locus where balance(x,p) = 0.
