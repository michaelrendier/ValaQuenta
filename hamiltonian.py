HamiltonianXP — H = xp (Berry & Keating, 1999)

The lossless semantic engine.

Classical orbit:     xp = E  (hyperbola — enumerates the primes)
Equations of motion: ẋ =  x  (no loops)

::

                     ṗ = -p  (no branches)

Scale invariant:     x → λx, p → p/λ, H → H (same at every language, every context)

The prime emerges from the evolution. It is not searched for.
No If/Then/Else. No While. Continuous flow.

Three phases are automatic::

  Classical orbit (xp = E)     → the semantic prime          [RED  / Riemann]
  Quantum zeros  (γₙ)          → the formant structure        [BLUE / Fermat]
  Time evolution (e^{iHt}|ψ⟩) → the carrier waveform         [Yang-Mills]
