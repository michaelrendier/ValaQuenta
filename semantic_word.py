SemanticWord — A word is its multidimensional context.

Not the surface form. Not the string.
The prime in semantic space — the invariant point — with all its projections.

A tree is still a tree in any language because TREE is the prime.
"tree", "arbre", "木" are coordinate systems pointing at the same point.
The multidimensional context IS the word.
