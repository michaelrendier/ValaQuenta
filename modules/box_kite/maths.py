============================================
THE BOX-KITE DEBUGGER -- making the zero-divisor geometry visible.

"how do we 'debug' the geometries / how do we watch the geometries
 interact"   -- Cody Michael Allison, 2026-08-05

WHAT THE OBJECT IS, AND WHERE IT IS NOT
---------------------------------------
Moreno (1997) proved the sedenions' norm-one zero divisors are
homeomorphic to the exceptional Lie group G2. That is TRUE and it is the
WRONG PLACE TO BUILD. de Marrais (2000), whose paper is a direct response:

    "Moreno discovered a homomorphism -- a 'blow-up' of an exact
     correspondence -- and the 'blow-ups' in the history of number theory
     have all entailed the loss of something."

G2 is the CONTINUOUS SHADOW. It forgets which Fano line is which. The
exact object is finite:

    PSL(2,7),  order 168,  = Aut(Fano plane) = GL(3,2)

PSL(2,7) is the finite subgroup of G2 that PRESERVES THE LABELLING. All
of this module's structure is exactly enumerable -- no sampling, no
fitting, no approximation. That exactness is the whole point of a
debugger.

THE STRUCTURE, DERIVED NOT ASSERTED
-----------------------------------
Everything below is computed from the Cayley-Dickson multiplication table
in this file. Nothing is read in from de Marrais; agreement with his
published counts is a CHECK, not an input. See verify_counts().

    15 pure imaginaries      = the 15 points of PG(3,2)
                               35 lines of 3, 15 Fano planes
    ASSESSOR                 = a plane span(e_a, e_{b+8}), a,b in 1..7
                               whose diagonals e_a +/- e_{b+8} zero-divide.
                               a == b never works -> 49 - 7 = 42 Assessors
    84 diagonals             = 42 Assessors x 2 signs
    168 primitive unit ZDs   = 42 x 4 (point-set quartets, +/- both
                               diagonals) = |PSL(2,7)|
    336 ordered ZD pairs     = each of the 84 diagonals kills exactly 4
    STRUT                    = a XOR b, in 1..7. Indexes the box-kite.
    7 BOX-KITES              = one per strut, 6 Assessors each, 7x6 = 42

THE SHAPE IS AN OCTAHEDRON. For each strut s the 6 Assessors form a
4-regular graph on 6 vertices with exactly 3 non-edges -- the reversal
pairs (a,b) <-> (b,a). That is K_{2,2,2}, the octahedron. Verified by
computation, not assumed: box_kite_graph() builds the adjacency from
actual vanishing products.

THE DISPERSION RELATION, CHART LEVEL
------------------------------------
The octahedral graph Laplacian spectrum is closed form:

    adjacency:  4, 0, 0, 0, -2, -2
    Laplacian:  0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6      <- omega^2(k) on one box-kite

Six modes: one zero mode, a 3-fold degenerate mode at 4, a 2-fold at 6.

THE ZERO MODE IS e_0. It is the mode that exists everywhere and
propagates nowhere -- which is exactly what a boundary GENERATOR should
look like from inside the geometry it generates. This falls out of the
graph; it is not put in by hand. It is the computational form of Cody's
own question, answered:

    "the 0_RB describes the geometries as its boundary generator... but
     it seems that it is NOT the geometries... am i correct in this one?"

Correct. e_0 is not one of the 15 pure imaginaries, so it is not a point
of PG(3,2), not a member of any Assessor, and not a vertex of any
box-kite. It cannot be: Assessors are planes spanned by pure imaginaries
and e_0 spans none of them. It is the axis the geometry is measured from
and it is not the geometry.

THE CURVATURE IS THE ASSOCIATOR
-------------------------------
    [a,b,c] = (ab)c - a(bc)

Exact, pointwise, and the direct analogue of a curvature tensor: it
measures how much the geometry bends under reassociation. The commutator
[a,b] = ab - ba is the torsion analogue. 1848 of the 4096 basis triples
have non-vanishing associator. associator_field() paints these onto a
box-kite's vertices and edges -- that is the debug view.

WHAT IS OPEN
------------
The GLUING. Each chart is flat enough to compute; the curvature lives in
the transitions between the 7 box-kites. glued_graph()/glued_spectrum()
assemble the naive 42-vertex union, which is a first model of the global
medium and NOT a derivation of one -- the transition maps are not yet
written. Stated here rather than implied.

#
# Cody, 2026-08-05: "i'm pretty sure that those 'surfaces' do actually touch
# somewhere... they are all from the fixed point anyway... it's all the same
# maths... but now we have a clue that 0_RB only points to 'fixed point
# space'... where the boundary and the geometries are the same thing"
#
# Correct, and the two statements are about DIFFERENT STRUCTURES on the same
# object. glued_graph() reports zero cross-strut EDGES -- that is the
# adjacency. It is not the whole story:
#
#   ADJACENCY (zero-divisor products):  the charts are DISCONNECTED.
#                                       7 components, 7 zero modes.
#   SKELETON  (shared basis indices):   the charts OVERLAP ALMOST TOTALLY.
#                                       Every one of the 14 usable indices
#                                       sits in 6 of the 7 charts.
#
# For strut s an Assessor has lower index a and upper index (a XOR s)+8, valid
# whenever a != s. So index a appears in every chart EXCEPT s = a -- six of
# seven, for all 14 indices. The charts touch everywhere in the skeleton and
# nowhere in the products.
#
# AND THE FIXED POINT IS WHERE THEY GLUE. Exactly two of the sixteen basis
# elements are in NO Assessor:
#
#   e_0   the identity -- 0_RB, the fixed point
#   e_8   the Cayley-Dickson doubling generator
#
# Each chart's Laplacian carries one zero mode, and a zero mode is the
# constant function -- i.e. the same object in all seven charts. Seven
# components, seven copies of one thing. IDENTIFY THE ZERO MODES AND THE
# ATLAS CONNECTS. That identification happens at e_0 and nowhere else, which
# is the precise sense in which "0_RB points to fixed point space, where the
# boundary and the geometries are the same thing": at the fixed point the
# boundary generator and the geometry's own mode ARE the same vector.
# Away from it they separate.
