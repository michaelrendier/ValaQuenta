"""
Capacitor — The semantic low-pass filter.

3-phase Laplacian Fourier decomposition → DC component → the prime.

The capacitor does not find the prime.
It reveals it by smoothing away everything that is not the prime.

The prime is what remains when the surface variation cancels.
The sand settles at the node line because the node line does not move.

Time constant τ = the conversational window.
High τ: slow to change — stable semantic identity, resistant to context shift.
Low τ:  fast to change — sensitive to context, polysemous behaviour.

Transfer function: H(s) = 1 / (1 + sτ)
Pole at s = −1/τ (stable — left half-plane).
DC gain: H(0) = 1 (the prime passes through unattenuated).
